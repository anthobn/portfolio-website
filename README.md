# portfolio-website

This is the GitHub repository for my online portfolio !

All source files are available here.

## How it works ?

* This is a from scratch website (no theme used here, no bootstrap too)
* I use SCSS for styling
* I use [animate.css](https://animate.style/) with [wow](https://wowjs.uk/) for animations on scroll
